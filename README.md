`					MOUNTAIN BLADE:
						John's Story

	In the distant land of Shagnusland, John Strucker was but a farmer. One day while harvesting the latest bounty 
of fruits and shank, a mysterious figure sprang up from the soil. 
	"OH MY!" John exclaimed.
	"I AM THE SPIRIT OF THE MOUNTAIN BLADE" The wise spectre explained.
	"I SEE." said John.
	"YOU MUST FIND ME SO YOU CAN LIBERATE THE LANDS OF SHAGNUSLAND"
	"OK"

	So John set out on his quest but did not know the way so he ran to his oldest friend's house. He knocked
on the door and there was no answer. He broke down the door and found that his friend had been murdered by the 
mountain men. 
	"NOOOOOO!" John cried. "I WILL HUNT DOWN THE MOUNTAIN MEN WHEREVER THEY ARE AND KILL THEM! BUT I DO
NOT HAVE A BLADE TO KILL THEM WITH!"

	So John went to a mountain and looked for the blade. But he did not find the blade. The Mountain Men saw
him for miles and started shooting arrows at him. He said, "NO! NO ARROWS!". 
	The Mountain Man Commander barked orders and threw axes at John. John knew that if he assassinated the
commander that that would end the battle right there. So he jumped over the fissure and rolled through the lines
and punched the commander and the battle began. John's fsce was split by a smile.  

	The commander swung his triple-sized battle axe at John but John was so faster that the Commander missed him
hit his own own men! They all died and it was one on one action. John shot him with the pistol in the eye and the
Commander ran away without it. The commander went back to the Mountain Man King and then he was killed for disobediance.
	
	John continued walking toward the final goal. He wanders for 23 years over the mountain range. And then he
he finds it! THE MOUNTAIN BLADE. BUT IT IS BROKEN IN HALF LENGTHWAYS! 
	"Noooooooooooooooooooo!" John explained
	"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES!" The Mountain Blade said!
	"You can speak to me?"
	"YES BUT JUST TO YOUJOHN!"
	"HOW DO I GET YOUR OTHER SIDE!"
	"MY BROTHER IS HELD BY THE DEMON DRAGON LORD OF THE DEATHLANDS, HOME OF THE FIERY DEAD!"
	"I WILL GO!"
	
	So John went to the Deathlands, home of the fiery dead. When he was there he looked upon the Demon
Dragon Lord's keep, Castle LIchtenstein. He broke down the doors with the strength of old and tore up the 
dragon guards and looked for the sword's brother.
	"WHERE ARE YOU!?!?!?" ejaculated John.
	"HERE" he heard back.
	THE DRAGON WAS THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(;!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
The half sword that John carried began to glow sensing its brother. 
	"I AM THE OTHER HALF!!!!" Said the dragon.
	"NOOOOOOOO!!!5" cried John.
They fought and clanged their swords. The dragon blew fire out of this mouthes and John clanged it away with his'
sword. As the dragon was about to deliver his killing stroke, a figure jumped out of the darkness and took the 
hit for John.
	"WHO ARE YOU!!?!??!" asked John.
	The shadows retreated to reveal it was the Mountain Man Commander!!! 
	"Kill the dragon as it is your only chance and I am also your uncle and this dragon is my brother." said 
the Mountain Man Commander.
	"WAIT!" explained John. "YOU MEAN THAT...........?"
	"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"

	"I WILL KILL YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DID TO MY FAMILY!" outcried John!
	"No John" spouted the dragon, "I am the family"
	"I WILL NOT LET YOU LIVE TO SEE THE EDGE OF THE DAY!" said John
	They fought for glory for 5 days in that underground castle. John raised his sword towards the heavens,
and it then was infused by the power of his forbearers. And struck the dragon into the Earthcrust and a fissure
opened up and John found himself in the underground DWARF FORTRESS!

# Dwarf Fortress: A John's Tale

````
				Dwarf Fortress: A John's Tale

10 Years have passed since the battle against the terrible Dragonlord. John woke up from his fall through
the Earthcrust and found himslef in the company of great KINGS of Dwarves. 
	"What man hath come down from the Earthcrust and intrudeded upon our Sacred Council of Undergrowth Dwarves."
	"I am John I have come from the Distant Lands of Shagnusland to claim my right to the throne of
	 Shagnusland." said John to the dwarves."
	"That title is NOT YOURS TO TAKE" explained the Dwarf King of the Undermountain.

John was sent to the dwarf prison and was given rations but he did not eat them. He looked to his side and saw
that his cell mate was THE MOUNTAIN MAN COMMANDER! 
	"FATHER!" said John
	"Come here son and I will show you the ways of the Mountain." pleaded Mountain Man Commander"
The Mountain Man Commander trained John in the Mountain Arts. The strength of the Mountain blade half increased
tenfold and John cut through the steel box that confined him. 
	"LET US GO UNCLE AND WE WILL ESCAPE!" said John
	"I cannot continue for my strength has been sapped from the training of you and I cannot continue..."
explained the Father of the Mountain.
	"I will never forget your deeds.""I will never stop fighting for your case." explained John.
John inserted the blade into the Mountain Man Commander's heart and felt the tang as the heart stopped beating. 
	"May your travels in the afterlife bring you many greetings from your loved ones. And never stop fighting"
Joh leaps from the prison with vigor and lands on the dwarf kings, crushing their ambitions.  
	"WHY!" yelled all the dwarf in unison.  "Then the goblins that the dwarves were at war with decided to make
their move for once and all, they came out of their holes with pitchfolks chanting the war cry of their people. 
	"I will do what needs to be done to win this fight so i can escape from this city and then i can return to
the people i once belonged to and i can save my father from the evil lord that rules the upper worlds.  "
 
	The goblins were doing their attack and John knew that if he was going to end the War of the Underdark 
then he would have to kill the leader of the dwarfs. As he was running to the royal guards he was stopped by
the royal guards and they used their pikes to keep him at bay but then when all hope seemed lost, a pitchfolk
commando squadron came in guns-blazing and mowed over the dwarfen royal guard. 
	"GO JOHN! WE WILL COVER YOU!" said the Pitchfolk Commando King.
	"THANKS MAN!" replied JOHN!
	
	John got to the King Dwarf and shouted "GIVE ME WHAT RIGHTFULLY BELONGS TO MY FAMILY AND I WILL SPARE 
YOUR NATION!" said John
	"YOUR MADNESS IS UNPROVOKED AND UNJUSTIFIED. I WILL NOT HAVE IT!" said King Lawgrim Lowbrow.
	As the ground split apart the two of them battled and the Dwarf King got into his dark machine and said,
"IT IS ENDED FOR YOU!" The saw blade got just 1 inch from John when an explosion gripped the cave and the machine
fell over backwards.
	"What was that?" asked John?
	"DO NOT FEAR" Said The Mountain Man Commander.
	The pitchfolk hit squad saluted the Mountain Man Commander as he was their secret leader.
	"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AT YOUR SIDE JOHN AND I ALWAYS WILL YOU DO NOT FEAR" pronounced the Mountain Man 
Commander.
	The King Dwarf of the Under-Crypts crawled beneath John's feet. "I besiege you John please do not kill me.
I will do anything for you!"
	"THEN SWEAR TO ME THAT YOU WILL NEVER SHOW YOUR FACE HEAR AGAIN! I WILL APPOINT A NEW KING AND HE WILL BE
JUST AND FAIR UnLIkE YOU!" said John.
	The Dwarf King walked out of the Lair and John said that all of the prisoners are released and that the
leader of the oppresed people is the new king and John and the Mountain Man Man left the Prison grounds and decided
to leave. 
	
	The Dragon Lord sat upon his Lava Throne under the Volcano. 
	"I must kill John and his Mountain Man Commander as he is the only one who can kill me. I will send my
most powerful evil warrior."
	A dark thing approached the throne "I am that." it said.
	
John continued leaving the fortress. 
	"Tell me a story from the old lands" said John to the Mountain Man Commander.
	"Okay" said the Mountain Man Commander as he picked up the tome of Old. 

	"In the dark town of Stabtonville a great mage of dark and great terrible power loomed over the people
and made them their slaves. A boy was born. His mother did not want him living in the evil place that she was
living in. So he mailed him away to a farm. His name...was JOHN!"

	"NO!" cried John. "I never knew that I was from that dark place!"
	"YOUR MOTHER SACRIFICED ALL SO THAT YOU COULD COME BACK AND SAVE HER! SHE WAS MY WIFE AND I LEFT TO FIND
YOU SO THAT YOU CAN DEFEAT THE SOURCERER!" said the MMC.
	John wept. The Mountain Man Commander placed his arm around John but then an arrow shot through it and 
the Mountain Man Commander yelpped in pain! A Dark Thing leapt into scene.
	"I have come to kill JOhn now" he said.
	So then the Dark Thing stabbed John and he died.

				John's Story Part 3:
				Too Human Too Furious

	John felt the icy hands of the Deathgod bind him.
	"You are mine JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER!" said the Deathgod.
	Just then, I light shined down from Mt.Olympus and a voice boomed
throughout the Deathgod's halls.
	"DO NOT TOY WITH LIFE, BROTHER!" the voice boomed.
	The Deathgod snarled and hissed and crackled. "THIS ONE IS MINE AND
HE WILL MAKE A FINE TROPHY FOR MY DREADHALLS!" said Deathgod.
	The voice threw a lightning bird down and hit the Deathgod and as
he staggered to ragain his footing above the cliff John wriggled out of
his grasp and he was levetiated up through the sky clouds.
	"NOOO! I WILL GET YOU JOHN AND IF NOT YOU I WILL KIDNAP YOUR FAMILY
MEMBERS!" the Deathgod hissed like a snake.

	"Where am I?" asked John? 
	"I am Odin son of Bodin, welcome to Mt.Olympus, I watched you on your
thirst for vengeance and knew that the icy talons of the Deathwatcher could
not claim your soul so quickly!" said Odin.
	"Who was that Deathgod?" queried Johnson?
	Odin's face grimaced as he spat "He is known by many names but I
know him as my brother LOKI son of Boki."
	John stated "Odin I need to get back to Earthcrust because I have to
help my father and get the Mountain Blade and free Shagnusland from the 
Mountain Men and claim my rightful place upon the thron of Shagnusland
and kill the Demon Dragon Lord and Kill the Dragonlord who tried to kill me
and save my Mother from the evil Illusionist and liberate my people from
that dark place."
	"NOT SO HASTY YOUNGLING" boomed Odin. "YOU ARE BUT A PALTRY FARMER
NO WARRIOR!"
	"But I must!" said John.
	"THEN TAKE MY SON THOR SON OF BORE. HE WILL STEER YOU RIGHTLY ON THIS
QUEST YOU BARE." boomed Odin.
	"I thank you for your patience and my audience" thanked John.

	John was teleported by a lightning bolt back to the Earthcrust and
found himself still stabbed by the Dark Thing's blade. He removed it from 
his bones and said "DARK THING FACE ME IN BATTLE AND THE CONTEST WILL END 
HERE!"
	The Dark Thing spun around and said "THAT BLADE WAS COATED WITH THE
DRAGON LORD'S DEATHMAGMA YOU CAN NOT LIVE!"
	John let loose a smirk, ", IT HAS BEEN REMADE WITH LIFE OF ODIN!"
He stabbed the dark thing and the dark thing exploded.
	"Now let me get ready for the vengence." John spurted" For he knew the 
road would be long and weary, and aslo he did not know how to get to the town 
where his mother was still buried alive by the evil grand wizard, becasue years 
ago the wizard erased John's memory when he was born.  
	"Let me light the way" squeezed Thor, God of Olympus, because Odin died
and Thor became the new God of Olympus and married the princess.  
	A great burst of dazzling life brightened the sky and John began to lean
towards the town of his goal. 
	"Follow that goal and your life will succeed." Thor said as he burst into flame.
	As the embers sizzled, John flew towards Stabtonville.
	"wait?" quized JOhn, he said, "look, in the ash of Thor!!" Sure enough there was 
the key to the town hat. John has just landed in the hinterland of the wizard controlled 
territory.  He felt gravity grow tenfold, but his strength was true and he stood.
	"GAURDS!!!!" said the Dark Minister.
	A thousand guards from all corners ran to John and held him at swords-length. 
	"BRING HIM TO MY TOWER OF NECROFLAME THE DUNGEON." commanded the Dark Minster.
	John was dragged FEET first to the dungeon and through inside with a proud whimper.
	"BRING HIM TO MY CONJURING CHAMBER GAURDS!" commanded the Dark Minstrel.
	John was dragged FEET first to the chamber and activated the timer. "TICK TOCK" he
whispered knowingly to himself.
	"WELCOME TO MY FILET OF SOUL!" said the Dark Seer. "DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST REQUESTS?"
	"LET ME STRETCH MY LEGS" said John.
	"FINE THEN YOU DIE" gloated the Dark Adviser.
	When the gaurds unshackeled his limbs John kicked the explosives off of his legs and
into the Conjuror's Mouth.
	"NEGO Victorim! John Belted, as he took safe distance from the blast the engulfed the Dark 
Vicar from the inside of his robes, the fire reached out with talons of the embodied phoenix and 
lustily devoured the guards, because it judged them to be truley evil.  
	"SON!" said the Mountain Woman Commander she was free from the evil spell that killed her. 
	"Mother..." said the John.
	The Mountain Man Commander knelt beside her mangled corpse.
	"This is where I belong..." said the MOuntain Man Commander.
	The Mountain Woman Commander furled back into her shell. The Mountain Man Commander followed.
	"Goodbye Father and Mother." pronounced John as their strength pierced his flesh cage. 
	And from his broken flesh lept a shadow.  
	"Get ready for my death punch John was scared for the first time in his life, he knew then it 
would be the last.  The shadow spoke: "Iam your inner evil, but i doubt you'll ever see me again!" 
With that, the dark thing blew away in the wind and John figured he had seen the last of him. 
	
	The town celebrated for Ninety Fortnights and pronounced John their leader forever. But little
did he see that the Demon Dragon Lord lurked in th shadows and formed the alliance with the Mountain 
Man King and the Dragon Lord. The End was nigh...

						John Halo Reach Beta Part Quad

	Flying on his Nethervulture, John surveyed his kingdom. All of the hills were bare of any evil as for the
past 15 years John and his army of 40 thieves cleansed the land of all the brigand forces. 
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in commanfs. "I see a huge army in the distance"
	They went there and the fighting began. John hacked up all the enemies in his view and his Darkvulture mount
ate all of the mounts of the enemies. 
	"Down Drago!" laughed John. The Deepvulture smiled a liar's grin and flew back to his nest at John castle.
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "There is the leader of the force!"
	The leader was none other than the MOUNTAIN MAN KING! The armies split apart and John and the Mountain Man
King met in the center of the battle arena. 
	"WONDERFUL DAY FOR A FEAST!" bellowed the jolly soul.
	"Release your army to my command and you will be set free." responded King John.
	"A LOSS IS A LOSER'S VICTORY!" boomed the King of the Mountain Band.
	"Then it is settled! We will have battle and you will end! it." 
	"I'VE EATEN SMALLER MEN FOR MORE!" blared the MMK.
	"THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOVE ME said the Mountain Man Commander as he stabbed the Mountain Man King in the back
with a dark dagger. "Son you are in danger you must depart as forces beyond my control are gravitating towards the
edge of a knife that if you stray but a little and you WILL FALL!" with that last word spoke, the Mountain Man
Commander was dragged back by his FEET to the Deathrealmlands by Ingor the Soul Incinerator.
	"THank you father. ENEMY TEAM YOUR COMMANDER IS DEAD AND I HAVE TAKEN THE FIELD YOU ARE MINE!" the enemy
army fell on their swords and the rivers ran as red as the lava of the volcano with the blood from their bodies.
	
	Days past. Then weeks. After 12 days, John took his best men and crusaded out the doors of the castle
riding upon Drago the Dreadvulture.
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "I am glad to be here with you at the end of
the world."
	John nodded at the Duncan and without any warning an ancient Roc flew past them and ate half of John's
men.
	"LET FLY THE DOGS OF WAR!" said John to the Zeppelin commander. The Zeppelin commander turned and signaled
the cannon squadron. They unleashed a military barrage of biblical portions upon the Titan Bird and it fell
to the ground. 
	"Burn the body so its diseases will die with it." explained John. "Our battle is not over steal yourselves
as I forsee an ancient enemy threat from beyond the grave is in charge of these attacks..."
	The Bat Riders of the Kingdom swam through the sky whilst John led them on through. 
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "I see the Dragonlord's Keep!"
	"Excellent scope!" pronounced John King.
	The Baker's dozen warriors went into the evil commonwealth and layed down their mounts. They did not want
to risk there rides as the keep was gaurded by the magician's evel flak catapults.
	"Listen men!," said King "We will sneak into the castle and assassassinate the Dragonlord and deactivate
his Serpentine Jihad upon the land. MEN OF SHAGNUSLAND WE WILL STAND AS ONE AND HOLD THE LINE IN THE KEEP AND! But
John was interrupted as the wasw A SCOUT beast in the mountain that saw them and ran to his master!
	"MEN IT IS TIME TO CHARGE AND FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH IS DRAWN!!!" the men ran at the castle and
dodged all of the fire bombs that shot out of the volcano."

MeanWhile in the Dragon Lord's Keep 
 
	"Does Jhon know your DARKEST SECRET, my sweet fledgling king?" chortled the Dragon king's aide
	"I should think not, his mother made me a promise that he would never figure out that I am indeed his 
brorther." skaffed the Demon king his second act as the dark king was to release his army of jetpack alien warriors 
who had gernades inside their bodies, for a little extra kick on the end.  
	All of the sudden the king saw out the window the army of John's army charging, prepare my best mount for 
this battle!!!! said the darkest king.  Screaming Dark Thunder Eel was what came out and John was suprised to see
it but he was confident in his valor and kicked his spurrs into the veins of his own mount to spur him on. 
	"Now that we have taken out the Flak Cats we can shall MOUNT ON to the Dragon's Roost!" said John.
	The entire battalion was almost on their's but an ambush fell like the Axeman's blade. 
	It was an alien jetpack warrior! "WE ARE THE CONVENT! AND WE HAVE BEEN MERCENARIED HIRED TO KILL ALL
WHO DISAVOW THE DRAGON LORD'S WISHES!" said Kleecang the Elder.
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "You go on we can handle this ramble!"
	JOhn leapt upon his Deathvulture and screamed through the murk and got to the top of the Dragonlord's
Tomb-Castle. 
	"I HAVE WAITED FOR YOU FOR NIGH 20 years." brooded the Dragonlord. "Gaze upon my Thunder Eel and feel
dread...!"
	John was thrown off his mount with emotion. He got up. 
	"I've got this one, John." said Drago. Drago breathed lightning onto the Dragonlord.
	The Dragon fell off and fell off the tower. "Ahh!" he said.
	The Thunder Eel was all that was left and his eyes fell back into his head and then he exploded and
knocked John off the tower.
	John fell down to the earthcrust and as he fell he collected the weapons of his fallen friends.  
Then he saw the dragon Lord falling too and remenbered his past transgresions.  
	"I AM THE WEILDER OF THE ANCIENT FIRE!" screamed John, this was his classic battle cry.  
HE began to fire up the jetpack he stole from an alien general so he could catch up to the falling Dragon lord.  
CLANG went their weapons as they met in mid-fall.  Their battle shook the landscape as they continued to fall 
towards the Earthcrust.  THe EArthcrust opened like a hungry maw and the two battlers fell in, and then out the 
side of the planet, the combatants were launched like a cannon into the ETHER of space.  
	"I've lost the Demon Lord, said John hopelessly as he crashed into a mysterious forest planet.

				John's Story Part 5: The Mystery of Planet Avatar

The treeline slaped John around like a pinecone.  
John ran through all of the jungle but could not get out of the jungle. He heard a forgin tongue
and leapt toward the noise with his sword drewn. 
"Hard" said the voice.
"WHo is that." asked King John
"I am the king of Avatar." said the voice
"Well I am the King of my home." rebuked John.
"Then let battle begin!" cried the voice.
Suddenly the sky darkend and all of the warriors of the bark rushed in with slingshoots and wooden
cruxbows. They shot at John but they missed because John whirred around and was as fast as the
night.

Suddenly the sky brightened and just as John was about to die reenterforcemenets came raining down
and fought off the slathering horde with their longsowrds and bows. And they were riding on their
skydragons.
John beckoned to the riders. And said. "Who art thoouh who saved mine life?2?"
The leader stepped off of his skydragon "We are the Skydragoons, we patrol this kingdom searching
for the one who will lead us to our freedom. I am Avatarn and I lead the Skydragoons."
John told them of his quest and they decided to join him so when they returned to the home planet
they met back with Duncan who is the second in command.
"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "10 years hath passed since you flew
as the eagle did to that planet."
"Now our team is assembled. And we can take down the evil Dragon brothers." said John.
So King John, Duncan the Second in Command, Dragoon Master Avatarn, and Thor, Lord of Olympus set
forth and flew through the clouds like a team of blades through cream.

It was not long and they hit the Castle of the Demondragonlordofthedeathlands and John screamed from
atop Drago, "I AM YOU KING AND A I DARE YOU TO FIGHT ME IN THE ARENA!"
The Castle opened in half and The D.D.L.o.D.L. came flying out of the castle and ravaged the land
scape. I will battle you but your loyal mutts will have to stay behind for this is between
you and me. said him.
So King John used his amulet and stopped time and went to the into the Arena and drew the mountain 
blade.
This Dragon was no fool and began fighting John with all he could muster but the power of the
Mountain inside of John was too much for him and he began to burst with pain. 
"YOU DARE TO FEAST UPON MY SOUL THEN YOU SHALL HAE IT!" and then the dragon cracked open and out
sprang a thousand sins of all of the kingdom. They wrapped up John and he could not escape and
one of them stole his amulet and he could not turn on time. 
John winced and spewed but it was not enough and he eyes drakened and he fell into a death sleep...

JOhn awoke and found himself in the most evil place in the entire universe. THIS, was 
The Palace of Torment, home of Ingor The Soul Incinerator and John was going to have to burn
the entire place to the ground...

John looked onto the ground and saw that he was alone for the first time in his life. All he wanted
to do was go back to his farm and reap the bounty that would have been in season now and he would
have gone back to the framer's market and sold them to gramma bonkers and gotten a coin or two.
"What foul magic does this SOul Incinerator do" John quizzed to the darkness.
John walked carefly into the dungeon and struck a match on the wall and lit it up the darkness. He
looked into the prison cell next to him as he was walking and stopped to look into the prison cell
next to him. There was a small man inside fo the cell.
"Do not go into the darkness John!" said the man
"How do you know my name/" said John
THe man cackled and poofed into a fire. A great voice boomed and then said "LET THE GAMES BEGIN"
John was thrust into an arena. Ingor stood tall up in the audience. "Ladies and gentlemen we
now watch John, King of all men fight to the death."
"I hath fought many men in my day and I still stand" spat spat John.
Ingor said "then kill this foe." he said
The Gate of Almazon opened and a figure walked from the shadows. 
"Father!?!" said John
THe Mountain Man Commander walked to John and said "JOHN I AM NOT MYSELF I AM BEING CONTROLLED BY
INGOR BECAUSE I GAVE MY LIFE TO SAVE YOURS ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO NOW
YOU MUST STRIKE ME DOWN SO THAT I WILL NOT KILL YOU BECAUSE I AM UNDER CONTROL OF INGOR THE SOUL
INCINERATOR AND IF YOU DO NOT KILL ME NOW I WILL GO TO THE EARTHCRUST AND EAT ALL OF THE HUMANS"
"NO!" said John but it was too late as John had already stabbed the Mountain Man Commander in the
face and he crimpled to the ground and then blood was ALL OVER!
"A WONDERFUL SHOW JOHN! BUT LETS STEP ON THE GAME!" Ingor said. Ingor opened the gate with magic
and a million dogs came out and tried to bite him.
John could not kill a million of them but then he had an idea. John put on his sin goggles and he
could see all the sins around him and he saw the sin of Patricide and grabbed it as it was the one
who stole his Talisman. 
"HA" screamed John as he tore the Sin's tongue out and used the talisman and continued Time back
on the Earthcrust. So Drago and Duncan jumped down and killed 300,000 dogs each and JOhn killed
399,999 dogs.
"WHere is the last foul beast?" gargled John as he was bathed in blood.
"MILORD" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "HELP ME!" Duncan's neck was torn off as
the last dog got to him while he was reloading. He slumped to the ground.

Drago ate the dog then.

Duncan's spirit sailed like the zephyr from his body through the land of Sin. John could see him 
though and grabbed his arm but he could not hang on.
"Milord!" yelped Duncan. Duncan was the second in command. "The sins of my past weigh me down I 
cannot leave"
Duncan's spirit was torn apart and his guts went everywhere.
John took off his goggles and screamed a scream that shattered the Halls of Destruction. John threw
the Mountain Blade at Ingor and it seared his face as it passed by.
"Ah!" spoke Ingor. "I have been touched by the Mountain." and with that. Ingor was no more.

John scooped up Duncan's ashes and rode away on Drago. Even though they had succeeded in battle
this day it seemed that all of the hope chance was gone.

						John's Story Part VI
						Laser Quest for Duncan

John John spent 18 years searching for through the Mountains of Shagnusland for a cure to death of 
Duncan. John's kingdom fell apart over the years and all the people got a new king and he was good
and becuase John was too distraced with the death of his second in command. So he was flying through the air of
the kingdom on Drago.
"This is the last village we have not checked yet for a cure." said John
"Do not worry John. Duncan still has a chance." squacked Drago the Dreadvulture.
They settled down on the groundcrust and went to the local ju-ju man. He entered his wampon hut and
said "Oh Elder of the Forest plains dost thou have the secret to resurction!!"
"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE JOHN" spoke the local ju-ju man. "I am your uncle and you father was my brother
I was sent down to Earth to help you out man. In order to save one's friend you must get three 
objects of great power and return here."
The local ju-ju man said to told John of these grand treasures. John went out and got them and gave
them to the local ju-ju man. 
"I have them now" spout John
"You have done well" said Uncle ju-ju. He raised his SPIRIT STICK and shook it and caused the Death
God to awaken from his darkslumber.
"HISS" said the Death God as he blew threw the ground.
"NO!" said John "Not Loki the son of Boki!"
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE. Loki grabbed the local ju-ju man and dragged him away. But then Duncan came
back to life becuase the presence of the death god caused a life reversal.
"Milord!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "I saw in the Death God's mind and he
means to kidnap your uncle."
John shuttered and spat "WE must stop him"
So John and Duncan leapt through the Deathportal and had to dodge all of the death grabbers. As
the billion arms of the damned tried to pull on their flesh but they all missed.

They landed in the Citidal of the Pain and began to fight all of the legion of the dead. Clang
went the shileds and the swords and then the cannons started to fire ON THEIR OWN MEN!!! The
undead commander in the back smiled becuase he knew that he would get them. John and Duncan
were hit by a cannon and where locked on up in a prison. 

But just as the Key of Eternety was turned in the Lock of their cell, Grimweld the Deathwarden was
neck snapped by a shadowy figure. 

The Figure ran away into a portal and left. John and Duncan ran into the Death Arcanium and looked
at all of the old tomes. 

"WAIT" SAID JOHN! I have an idea!

John opened up the Tome that said "TIME TRIVAL!" and read the incantion. A portal opened up and John
ran through it. He was brought back to the jail cell and he went around and snapped Grimweld the
Deathwarden's neck. He flippped a coin and winked at his past self and leapt once again into the
portal but when he was back in the Dark Library all of the Bonelords had Duncan hostage and JOhn
ran up to them and used a sword. But the Boneloards had Sowrds made of bones that were harder than
steel and they cut through Johgn's sowrd. So John shouted the incantiaion and TIme stopped and John
took one of their BOne swords and cut em up. And then time started again.

John and Duncan fought side and side against all of the Boneguardians but after a long time they
saw that there were a infinity of them! THEY DID A TACTICAL RETREAT. But it was actually a feint
and all of the guards fell for it and they snuck by. They climbed the 10-Mile Tower up the stairs.
When they gotted to the top they found Loki.

"I got you said John" but when JOhn stabbed him in the head it was actually a decoy. John took
off the mask and it was acutally the Mountain Man Commander! 

He slowly got to his feet. "John" he said "John they took my brother here. Loki son of Boki is
bleeding him for secrets."
Duncan bowed his head
John looked at the sky and then John said "We will rescue him and we will make sure that none of 
the kingdom secrects are disavowed."

Ground cracked and sparks showered the evilscape. Everyone was tossed like the ragdoll and Loki
jumped in. Loki took out the Deciever's Flintlock Pistol and pointed it straight away at John's
solarplexis. 
"NOTHING CAN STOP MY EVIL!" chortled Loki but then out of the castle gates came THE GHOST OF ODIN'
RIDING ON the chariot
"I AM ODIN AND YOU MAY SHALL NOT TOUCH THIS KING!" Loki looked down and his heart was bleeding out
of his chest. And then it sprouted wings and flew over to John's grasp.

Odin looked down at John. ANd he said. "JOhn you now hold the liar's heart. YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE
WHAT MUST BE DONE TO IT!" and Odin poofed off.

John took the heart back to town and brought it to Fangdom the Blacksmith. Together they smelted the
heart into the Mountain blade and it was sharper than ever. He swong it around and showed off his 
skill and knew that it was time to end it.

			JOHN'S STORY FINAL CHAPTER
				JOHN ON FIRE
					
Johnothan the king of all men was making his way to the FINAL GOAL-LINE his dead family members 
all beckoned to him with mangled limbs and stumps and 10 inch bamboo skewers that had his name 
written. Pepsid the ALl-seer steped in.  
	"I bet you're woundering why i brought you to the edge of time, chortled Pepsid the best 
best man. Well, i'm sure you're sick of all the mystery, so get redy for me to anser all the queries.  
	
	10 years later.

	John swung the mountain blade at the Serpent Lord but the snake 
master was too fast and argile. The snake thrust his tail at John and it
knocked him to the ground.
	A mystical light shown down upon John at this point and a voice 
whispered into his mind "JOHN! I AM THE GHOST OF THE MOUNTAIN!"
	"I CANNOT DEFEAT THIS FOE." said John.
	"TRUST IN THE GODS AND ALL IS POSSIBLE." responded the spook.
	"OKAY!" screamed John and then he leapt up and used a sword tornado
attack that he learned from his father and he the snake into 100 pieces.
	"I YIELD!" said the Serpent Lord.
	"WHERE IS THE DRAGON!???!" yelled John at him!
	"I will not tell you because he would kill me!" said snake.
	John smirked a smirk "I will kill you if the Dragon
	The Serpent Lord said "He is where you began. At your farm. Your wife and unborn child
will be his dinner and he will pick his teeth with your house!"
	John was sooooo angry that he gobbled the snakeman's eyes. And then it was time for justice.
But the dragon was a foe too great for just him. So he would have to go back in time and collect
all of his allies when they were at their best...

	At John's Farm The Dragon was using his strategy and decided that he had to go back in time
and collect all the greatest enemies of JOhn and use them as a army...

	John clasped The Amulet of Nargoth. He had to think of the color assosiated to the time he
wanted to go to because that is how the amulet worked. So poof went and then he was in time. He
swam through the time and arrived back on the Mountain. He saw that in the distance was the 
Mountain Man Commander and the troops were shooting those wicked arrows. He had to change time and
bring the Mountain Man Commander with him. So he dodged the axis and the arrows and did a 360
vertical spin over the smolders and grabbed the Mountain Man Commander by the head. 
"LISTEN" said John "I am your son! We MUST go in time and kill the Dragon!!!"
	So John and the Mountain Man Commander jumped into the worm's hole and landed in a nother
time. They were next to a TICKING TIME bomb. But it was full of cogs and gears. John studied all of 
the wires and the Mountain Man Commander untied Duncan and Drago. 
	"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "This bomb has a hex placed upon
it! If you try and clip the wires it will fire up!"
	"RUUUUUUUUUUN!" cooed John! The four of them ran away and then the bomb exploded and they
were blown away into the worm's hole. And they all went into seperate times.

				SECTION II: Drago's Story

	Drago the dreadvulture was thrown 100 miles an hour at Mount Olympus and went straight
through it. Zues's palace began to crumple and the entire peak started falling down. All of the
gods fell out and Drago had to do it quickly and get Thor because he is who they needed. He sifted
mid air through all the gods that fell out and they were only 7 feet from the ground when he
grapped Thor in his Blade Beak and flew skyword into the Sky.
	Thor flong around and then onto the Vulture's back. COME ON NOW DRAGO LETS SAVE JOHN HE
SAID AS HE THREW MILLER ,THE HAMMER OF SPARTA, INTO THE SKY AND CAUSED A TIME RIFT THAT THEY
WENT RIGHT THROUGH.

				SECTION III: Duncan's Day

	Duncan was thrown 100 miles per hour at the village. He stood up and saw the instant that
the Death God Loki was grabbing the local Ju-Ju man. He knew that he had to stop him as that 
was hiss mission. Duncan used a bow and an Arrow with an explosion tipped trigger and shot it at
Loki. It hit it and it howled at the sky in pain. But then he recovered and Loki and Duncan fought
for Mortal Combat. 
Loki shot lies and Duncan but Duncan shot truth right back and the when the lies and the truth
met in the middle of the battlefield they exploded and revealed the true winner and it was 
Duncan and he grabbed Uncle Ju Ju and leapt into the Wyrn's Hole through time. 

			SECTION IV: John spills the Blood

	John was thrown 100 miles a hour out of the worm's hole. John found himself back in the
Stabtonville and was held by swordslength by 10,000 gourds. JOhn swung the Mountain Blade around
and began cutting up all of the gourds and they dropped their guns. John picked up two 50 cal.
pistols and shot the rest of them and SOMETIMES A BULLET WENT THROUGH 5 PEOPLE AT A TIME. 
He went to the shovel and went to the graveyard and dug up the Mountain Woman Commander from
her watery grave andshe stood up.
	"Thanks J-J, lets finish it. She picked up two 50 calibur Rocket launchers and they went
through the wyrm's hole. 

All of them were at ready for the final mission. Die or. It was do or die. 

King John, The Mountain Man and Woman Commanders. Drago the Dreadvulture, Duncan the Second in 
Command, Uncle Ju-Ju, and Thor son of Bor began their long boat ride to the Isle of Consequences.

When the boat slammed into the rocky cost of the Island, the seven heroes were greeted by 100
million evil archers that all shot aroows at them.

Get behind me!" SCREAMED Uncle Ju-ju. He waved his hands and summoned a ju-ju shield but there
were two many arrows and they broke through and shot Uncle Ju ju and filled him up with arrows
until there was not man left and just a man made of arrows.
John said a praer and touched Uncle Ju-Ju's arrow body and it fell apart and his spirit was 
finally free of the curse that was played upon it.

The Mountain Woman Commander stayed with the boat. So John, MMC, Duncan, Drago, and Thor ran on
dodging arrows and cannon ballss and slings and magic shots. 

THey were almost at the finish line when a sound fillled with metal and creaks leapt off the sky.
It was landed! It was the Dwarf King Lawgrim Lowbrow in his Dark Machine!
"PREPARE FOR VERSION 1.2!!!!" barrowed the Small King.
His robot shot chainsaws out of the armcannons and the heroes dodged them. THe Dwarf King saw
that he was no match for the 5 of them. So he shot a chinsaw in the ground and the ground shattered
and the Dark Machine fell in and the Dwarf was eaten by a Lava Worm. 

Everyone was hanging onto the presipise of ground. Drago flew around and scooped everyone up and
flew toward the Keep of Consequences. 

THe Flight of Drago was going smothly until A DRAGON LUFTWAFFLE AIR STRIKE TALON GROUP started
buzzing around. Everyone started firing their guns. Duncan took out a granade and pulled the pin
and pulled it at the dragons. When it blew up all the dragons fell apart. 

THey were nearing the END OF THE LINE and they all hopped of of Drako. The door in the keep was 
too small so Drago had to stay behind because he was engorged.

"I will hold them off John" howled Drago
"Thank you Drago I will never Die" said John as he spun on his heel and into the keep.

The keep was so dark that not on of them could see in their face. A laser grid dropped down and
their sepereated! The Demon Dragon Lord stepped out. 
"haha you have fallon into my trapt." he spouted in flame.
"Now I am going to eat you guys one one by one!" his mouth was opening but Thor flew around
and smashed the dragpin in mouth with his Hammer.
"ODIN'S WHELP TRIES TO DISMANTLE ME!" said the dragon. 
Thor swong Miller the hammer so hard that the Dragon's Head fell off and rolled around. BUT THERE
WERE SPARKS! No guts were coming out of the dragon because there were a lot of cogs and gears and
bands. Looking inside John saw a figure. It was a man.
"NO I DO NOT BELIEVE IT!" John exclamed. "My friend!'"
John's best friend faked his own death in that cottage and was actually operating the Deamon Dragon
Lord as a robot. 
"MILORD!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "Your friend lies in that machine.
That answers all of the unanswered questions."
"Yes it does" said John as he said a prayer and blessed his old friends mangled body.

Only a few rooms remained unscathed in the keep but JOhn and friends knew that if they wanted to win
the war that they would haive to kill all the enemies so they split over to cover more rounds. 

The Mountain Man Commander and Thor went in one room and John Duncan went in not the other. 

John looked around in the dark room that he and Dun can went in. He could not see ANYTHING IN THE 
DARK. IT WAS SO DARK THAT HE COULD NOT SEE ANY THING. NO THING. 

A Dark Thing leapt out of the darkness and sapped John in the head with a blackjak. Band. John was
out in the cold. He fell off the floor unconsoius. It was just Duncan and the Dark Thing.

Duncan withdrew his Ninja Samurai sword. He had been trained in this arts by Master Samura Jaquix
Magderoix. The Dark Thing grinned and then they started swords. Duncan jumped over the Dark Things
sword and while it was OFF KEY Duncan cut the Dark THing from spine to head.
"Milord!" yelped Duncan. Duncan is the second in command. "It is over brother." and Duncan watched
as his brother's corpse blew away in the wind tunnel.

Alone, John ran up the stair case. 2 MINUTES PAST! He opened the door and saw that at the top of the
tower was the final goal.
Finally he had reached his farm. All of the bounty of shanks and fruits were darkened by the
evil and a bite from them would kill a man. The door to his farm burst open and the final 
villian burst out. 
"NO" saad John "It can't not be!"
"YES!!!!" it was John's Inner Evil. It was the final puppetmaster that pulled all of the strings.

John stared down his inner evil. The ran at eachother and started ju-jitsu and things and fighting.
It started to rain and thunderstrom. But they KEPT ON fighting. John was knocked to the ground.
John's Inner Evil looked at him "I told you the second I met you I was going to give you a death
punch." 
So the Inner Evil's fist was wrapped in all manner of evil and plunged it into John's stomach. 
His Inner Evil grinned from eye to eye and his eyes then opened up wide.
"TIME FOR MY EVIL UPHEAVAL!!!!1" shouted John's Inner Evil to the gods.
John started laughing quietly. His inner evil looked down. 
"Why do you laugh when I beat you to death!" asked the inner e.
"Have you?" John quizzed. The Inner Evil was shocked to see that John's fist had already been rapped
in light and good and had plunged into Evil's stomach. 
His inner evil staggered up and John's fist snapped off in the innner evil's stomach. Light burst
out of the Inner Evil's eyeballs and then his legs blew up and his arms twisted in 460 and then
his neck blew up. John's inner evil was dead.


					John's Epilogue:
					Becker Late Than Never

The Forces of evil were destoryed for ever on that day. But a price was paid. King John and his 
entire family had been slaughtered. 

Duncan became the new King of Shagnusland with Drago as his second in command.

No one ever forgot the story of John and the Mountain Blade and the minstrels and the jokers would
tell it to the children. 

The End...




































...or was it?

				John's Epilogue Part II:
					Kevin Likes Men!
					
The blood from John's body soaked the soil of his farm. A mysterious figure sprang up.
"John I am the spirit of the Mountain Blade. A man such as yourself you have been granted access
into the Halls of the Mountain."
John's body burst open and his spirit rose from the ashes and levitated into the sky and into the
Halls of the Mountain and they were made of clouds.

John was greeted by the Mountain Man Commander, The Mountain Woman Commander, Thor, and Odin. 
The Mountain Man Commander grabbed John's shoulder and boomed.

"JOHN IT WAS A LONG JOURNEY BUT I TOLD YOU THE DAY I MET YOU THAT YOU WERE GOING TO DESTROY ALL
THE EVIL IN THE INTIRE WORLD NOW YOU ARE THE KING OF THE MOUNTAIN ALL HALE JOHN KING OF THE
MOUNTAIN."

John raisd the Mountain Blade into the air. The Mountain was finally whole again.
